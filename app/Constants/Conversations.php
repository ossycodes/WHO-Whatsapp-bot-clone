*WHO Myth-busters*

There is a lot of false information around. These are the facts.

🔢 People of all ages CAN be infected by the coronavirus. Older people, and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus. 

❄️ Cold weather and snow CANNOT kill the coronavirus.

☀️ The coronavirus CAN be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates

🦟 The coronavirus CANNOT be transmitted through mosquito bites.

🐶 There is NO evidence that companion animals/pets such as dogs or cats can transmit the coronavirus.

🛀 Taking a hot bath DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus

💨 Hand dryers are NOT effective in killing the coronavirus

🟣 Ultraviolet light SHOULD NOT be used for sterilization and can cause skin irritation

🌡️ Thermal scanners CAN detect if people have a fever but CANNOT detect whether or not someone has the coronavirus

💦 Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body WILL NOT kill viruses that have already entered your body

💉 Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, DO NOT provide protection against the coronavirus.

👃 There is NO evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people from infection with the coronavirus. 

🧄 Garlic is healthy but there is NO evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic has protected people from the coronavirus.

💊 Antibiotics DO NOT work against viruses, antibiotics only work against bacteria.

🧪 To date, there is NO specific medicine recommended to prevent or treat the coronavirus.

    const TRAVEL_ADVICE = "
WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.

It is prudent for travellers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas, in particular for elderly travellers and people with chronic diseases or underlying health conditions. “Affected areas” are considered those countries, provinces, territories or cities experiencing ongoing transmission of COVID-19, in contrast to areas reporting only imported cases. 

General recommendations for all travellers include:

🧼 Wash your hands frequently

👄 Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose

💪 Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze

↔️ Stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick

🍗 Follow proper food hygiene practices

😷 Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.

Travellers returning from affected areas should:

🌡 Self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days and follow national protocols of receiving countries. Some countries may require returning travellers to enter quarantine. 

🤒 If symptoms occur, such as fever, or cough or difficulty breathing, travellers are advised to contact local health care providers, preferably by phone, and inform them of their symptoms and their travel history.
